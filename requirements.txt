# This requirements file lists all third-party dependencies for this project.
# These days I would just recommend a fresh install of Anaconda which comes with
# all the goodies.

# if you prefer to use virtualenv (for setting a local environment)

# > pip install virtualenv
# > cd pyPDBeREST
# > virtualenv venv
# # using your python interpreter
# > virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 lib
# > source venv/bin/activate
# > pip install -r requirements.txt
# > deactivate

# otherwise just (global install)
# > pip install -r requirements.txt
